 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of various Data Warehousing and Mining (DWM) practicals completed as part of the Semester VI curriculum. The practicals focus on data preprocessing, transformation, OLAP operations, and key machine learning algorithms used in data mining.
Practicals Implemented:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing Values in Python üõ†Ô∏è
Implemented various techniques to handle missing values, such as mean/mode imputation, interpolation, and removal.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Flow Transformations in ETL ‚öôÔ∏è
Implemented common ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) transformations for data preprocessing.
Included filtering, aggregation, and schema mapping techniques.
3Ô∏è‚É£ OLAP Operations on a Multi-Dimensional Data Cube üìä
Explored Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) operations such as roll-up, drill-down, slice, and dice.
Worked with multi-dimensional data for analytical insights.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Apriori Algorithm for Frequent Itemset Mining üõí
Implemented the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent itemsets in transactional data.
Used support and confidence thresholds to generate association rules.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm ü§ñ
Implemented the Na√Øve Bayes classifier for text classification and probabilistic prediction tasks.
 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm üìå
Implemented the KNN algorithm for classification tasks.
Evaluated model performance with different values of K.
7Ô∏è‚É£ K-Means Clustering Algorithm üîç
Implemented K-Means clustering for unsupervised learning.
Visualized cluster formation using data visualization techniques.
8Ô∏è‚É£ Decision Tree Algorithm üå≤
Implemented a decision tree model for classification tasks.
Used information gain and entropy to build decision rules.
9Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Regression üìà

Implemented linear regression to analyze relationships between dependent and independent variables.
Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R¬≤ scores.
